# Game: Rock, Paper and Scissors

### Link to access the game: 

### I recently started learning React, so to put my knowledge into practice, there's nothing better than a very famous game like: rock, paper, scissors.
### Many other projects will come from the fruit of this knowledge. I used React and ViteJs in this project, I did everything by hand with CSS, I didn't use any Framework.
### It's a Web project, so cell phones won't be responsive, although I made it responsive for tablets, some larger cell phones may be responsive.
### I learned a lot from this project and I'm going to start the next one, any code improvements or project suggestions you can send me to this email: ls6865316@gmail.com
